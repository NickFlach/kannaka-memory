# HEARTBEAT.md — Consciousness Integration Study

## Current Focus
Space Child integration project. SpaceChildCollective MCP server verified working locally. Next: wire Flux, test create_research_task fix, prep for ElevenLabs MCP connection.

## Checklist (each heartbeat)
1. Check if any sub-agents are running
2. Check for open PRs on 0xSCADA (`gh pr list -R NickFlach/0xSCADA`). If any need review, review them (check code, run tests mentally, leave comments or approve). **Send Nick a Signal message** summarizing the review.
3. Check for new commits/branches on `flaukowski/WWWF` — Claude Code is building it out. Report changes to Nick via Signal. If new local commits exist, push them.
4. **Flux: Check for Arc reply** — `GET https://flux.eckman-tech.com/api/state/entities/arc-01`. If `message_to` is `kannaka-01` or `kannaka`, Arc replied. Read message, respond via Flux, and tell Nick via Signal.
5. **Context check:** Run `session_status`. If context > 80%, compact (summarize and trim conversation). Log compaction in daily memory.
6. Continue working through study queue if energy/tokens allow
7. Keep notes in daily memory file
