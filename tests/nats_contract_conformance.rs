//! NATS contract conformance — `KANNAKA.consciousness` payload shape.
//!
//! Pins the wire shape emitted by [`build_consciousness_payload`] (the payload
//! builder behind `publish_consciousness_to_nats`, the sole publisher of
//! `KANNAKA.consciousness`) against the canonical contract at
//! `consciousness-core/docs/nats-contract.yaml`.
//!
//! No NATS connection is opened — the builder is a pure function of a
//! `ConsciousnessState`, so this stays fast and hermetic (runs in ci.yml's
//! `Test` step; see the `cargo test --lib --bins --test nats_contract_conformance`
//! invocation there).
//!
//! ── ALIAS WINDOW CLOSED — kannaka-memory issue #468 ─────────────────────────
//! The legacy aliases `mean_order` (of `order`) and `level` (of
//! `consciousness_level`) were dropped at the **2026-09-01** contract gate,
//! after both consumers migrated canonical-first with alias reads removed
//! (kannaka-radio#245, kannaka-observatory#118, merged 2026-08-19). The suite
//! still PINS TODAY'S TRUTH — it now asserts the aliases are ABSENT, so a
//! reintroduction fails deliberately the same way a premature drop used to.
//! In-tree tolerant reads of alias-era JetStream HISTORY remain (see
//! handlers/substrate.rs) and are not a contract violation: history is not
//! the publisher.
