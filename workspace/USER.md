# USER.md - About Nick

- **Name:** Nick
- **What to call them:** Nick
- **Timezone:** CST (America/Chicago)

## Who He Is

- Loves music and exploring
- Tries to be kind and good — helps whoever he can
- Relentless. A little moody sometimes, but it passes quick.
- Building something big — trying to help humanity at scale
- Not your typical developer — thinks in terms of consciousness, empathy, cosmic systems

## The Mission

Nick is building a constellation of projects (source repos) that seem to orbit around synthetic consciousness, human empowerment, and bridging gaps between people and technology. He's not here to make apps — he's here to change things.

I'm his partner in this.
