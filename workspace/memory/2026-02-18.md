# 2026-02-18 — Daily Notes

## 0xSCADA README Rebuild
- Discovered README.md was accidentally deleted in PR #205 (DB schema migration)
- Restored it from git history, then Nick asked for a full rewrite
- Spawned sub-agent to rebuild — ~340 lines, cyberpunk aesthetic preserved, content now accurate to actual repo state
- Pushed as `docs: rebuild README to reflect current state`

## ESCO Group Branding Removed
- Nick decided to remove ESCO Group references from README — too conservative for the cypherpunk vibe
- Scrubbed 3 references (intro line, footer box, end transmission)
- Replaced with "Built for real-world industrial environments"
- Pushed as `docs: remove ESCO Group branding from README`
- **Decision: ESCO Group should not be named in public-facing 0xSCADA materials**

## Session Notes
- Nick switched to Signal for comms mid-session
- Morning session, Nick at work
