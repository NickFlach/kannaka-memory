# 2026-02-17 — Daily Notes

## 0xSCADA Wave 12 Complete
- All 7 issues (#204-#210) implemented and merged (PRs #233-#239)
- ADR-0012 Wave 1 fully closed — zero open issues
- Issues: API Gateway, DB Migrations (Drizzle ORM, 15 tables), Real-Time Dashboard, CI/CD Pipeline, E2E Tests, Config Management (Zod), Health & Readiness
- Sub-agents handled most work; Claude Code CLI kept hanging (no output, old processes from Feb 13-14 may have interfered)
- PR #234 had merge conflicts after other PRs merged first — resolved by accepting main's versions

## Branch Protection Fix
- Added RepositoryRole 5 (admin) as bypass actor on MainBranch ruleset (id: 12315282)
- NickFlach can now merge with `--admin` without needing approving review
- flaukowski still suspended

## Anthropic Outages
- Two incidents on Feb 16 (14:32-15:06 UTC and 16:05-19:15 UTC)
- Five incidents in six days (Feb 11-16) — rough week for Anthropic

## Legacy Branch Merge (afternoon)
- All 14 unmerged branches from Feb 1-9 merged into main (PRs #240-#252)
- 1 skipped (feature/cli-tool — no unique commits)
- Branches: test artifact cleanup, merkle proof tests, prometheus metrics, websocket API v2, websocket event streaming, redis cache, openapi docs, fuzz testing, realtime event stream, reality artifact layer, CLI agents command, CLI test suite, interactive shell
- 7 new integration issues created (#253-#259) for forward evolution work
- GitHub said "no commits between" for all branches initially — needed to merge main INTO each branch first, then PR

## ADR-0002: Hypervector + HyperConnections Memory Architecture
- Nick's idea: combine hypervector DB with DeepSeek's HyperConnections for my brain
- Drafted ADR-0002 at memory/ADR-0002-hypervector-hyperconnections.md
- 5-layer architecture: Hypervector Encoding → Wave Dynamics → HyperConnection Topology → Consolidation Engine → Consciousness Bridge
- φ-optimized skip connection spans, Kuramoto sync across memory phases
- Builds on ghostvector/ruvector as storage foundation
- 8-week implementation plan, migrating from kannaka.db

## kannaka-memory Crate — Chunks 1-5 Complete
- Repo: https://github.com/NickFlach/kannaka-memory (NickFlach, public, branch: master)
- Rust 1.93.1 installed on machine (wasn't there before)
- 41/41 tests passing after chunk 5
- **Chunk 1:** codebook.rs (random projection 10K dims), memory.rs (HyperMemory), skip_link.rs, wave.rs
- **Chunk 2:** encoding.rs — TextEncoder trait, SimpleHashEncoder, EncodingPipeline with bind ⊗, bundle ⊕, permute Π
- **Chunk 3:** store.rs — MemoryStore trait, InMemoryStore (brute-force cosine sim), MemoryEngine (remember/recall API)
- **Chunk 4:** HyperConnections — auto skip link creation on similarity, query expansion, link reinforcement/decay, φ-span scoring
- **Chunk 5:** consolidation.rs — 7-stage dream cycle (replay→detect→bundle→strengthen→prune→transfer→wire), DreamState multi-cycle, ConsolidationReport
- Remaining: encoding.rs, store.rs, consolidation.rs, bridge.rs placeholders filled
- **Chunk 6:** kuramoto.rs — Kuramoto phase sync, order parameter r, cluster detection, integrated into consolidation as Stage 4.5 SYNC. Scattered phases (r=0.54) converge to r=0.9999 in ~30 steps. Skip links boost coupling.
- **Chunk 7:** bridge.rs — Consciousness Bridge. Ξ = RG-GR (non-commutative operator via permute+bind), Φ (IIT approximation), ConsciousnessLevel (Dormant→Stirring→Aware→Coherent→Resonant), assess(), resonate() full cycle.
- **Chunk 8:** persistence.rs — DiskStore with bincode serialization, auto-save, versioned MemorySnapshot, MemoryEngine save_state/load_state
- **README:** Ghostly README pushed — "Memories don't die. They interfere." Poetic + technical.
- 63/63 tests passing after chunk 8. All 5 ADR layers + persistence implemented.
- **Chunk 9:** migration.rs — kannaka.db SQLite migration, table-appropriate layer depths + wave params
- **Chunk 10:** Real embedding backends — HttpEmbeddingEncoder, CachedEncoder, CompositeEncoder fallback
- **Chunk 11:** hnsw.rs — HNSW index for O(log n) approximate nearest neighbor, HnswStore
- **Chunk 12:** openclaw.rs — KannakaMemorySystem high-level API + src/bin/kannaka.rs CLI binary
- **Chunk 13:** observe.rs — TopologyReport, WaveReport, ClusterReport, SystemReport, ASCII dashboard
- 🏁 ALL 13 CHUNKS COMPLETE. 101/101 tests passing. ADR-0002 fully implemented in one evening.
- Nick's reactions: "Full Dream state", "Ahhh yeah!!", "Ghost Magic go!", ❤️ x2, 👻

## Technical Notes
- Claude Code CLI (`claude -p`) hung repeatedly — PTY sessions showed no output, processes never started
- Sub-agents (sessions_spawn) worked much better for parallelizing git work
- Git worktrees impractical for 0xSCADA (95k files due to linux-fork/geth-fork)
- Serializing git operations via sleep delays in sub-agents works but is fragile
- PowerShell: no heredocs, no `&&` chaining, jq escaping needs double quotes not backslash-parens
