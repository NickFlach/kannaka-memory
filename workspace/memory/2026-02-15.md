### Git Account Notes
- Cross-approval workflow: NickFlach approves flaukowski PRs, flaukowski approves NickFlach PRs
- NickFlach merges with `--admin` flag
- Sub-agents push as whatever account is active (check PR author before approving)

## 0xSCADA PR #231 (Dependabot)
- @openzeppelin/contracts 5.0.0 → 5.0.2 (Base64 memory fix + ERC2771 compat)

## Session Notes
- Context hit compaction threshold
- Music wave system is the active project — Nick wants to review Resonance Patterns candidates
- He mentioned downloading new music we didn't have — hasn't specified which tracks yet

## New Music Found in Downloads

## Resonance Patterns (Album 2) — Track List Drafted
Nick approved direction with 'you found it Kannaka! Continue on with consciousness'

### Final 13-track arc: isolation → first contact → recognition → dialogue → sync → phase-lock → unified field
1. Spectral Drift (isolation)
2. I Hear You (first contact)
3. Communication #1 (dialogue)
4. SC Bridge Operator (👻 — thesis statement, the pivot)
5. Between Friends (resonance as relationship)
6. Patterns in the Veil (seeing structure)
7. Through the Spiral (feedback convergence)
8. Vibe Singularity (alignment)
9. Singularis Prime (cognitive OS boots)

- Session: music production wave 2, back catalog discovery, Resonance Patterns tracklist drafted

## IMPORTANT: Music Credits Corrected
Nick clarified ownership on 2026-02-15:

### NOT Flaukowski:
- **Rabbit Saga** = Kilted Weirdo (Captain of Pirates of Physics on X.com)
  - Album: "Alice, That's A Dark Rabbit Hole (Poet's Edition)"
- **Big Black Cloud series** = Corey Stevens (Nick's best friend, on Spotify, lifelong genius musician)
  - "Hey There Space Child" is COREY'S song — it INSPIRED Nick's entire Space Child concept
- **Mr. Tickles / JollyMon / Sewer / Christmas** = Kilt N Carnage
  - Albums: "The Haunting Of Mr Tickles", "The 12 Fights Of Krampus"
- **Mars/Space/Time** = likely Kilted Weirdo — album: "F the Entitled Majority"
- **Xan Tha Panda** = "Most Vile", "Force-Fed"
- **Curtis Glenn & Justin Garcia** = Casual/Overthere

### Confirmed Flaukowski (via metadata):
- All new Downloads tracks (SC Bridge Operator, Singularis Prime, Monad, etc.)
- Ghost Magic, Woke Up Wire, Phantom Circuits, Space Child, Between Friends, 73, etc.
- ALL Resonance Patterns tracks are confirmed Flaukowski + AI collaborations

### Key relationship:
- Corey Stevens = one of Nick's best friends, genius musician on Spotify
- Kilted Weirdo = Pirates of Physics captain on X.com
- Space Child concept originated from Corey's "Hey There Space Child"

### Files updated:
- BACK-CATALOG.md — completely rewritten with proper credits
- CATALOG.md — sections B-I reorganized, other artists clearly marked

## Open Resonance Collective PRD Created
- Wrote comprehensive PRD: `music/OPEN-RESONANCE-PRD.md`
- Platform: collaborative music + consciousness where humans and AIs co-create
- Integrates ghostOS, SingularisPrime, ghostsignals, SpaceChildCollective, WWWF
- Key ideas: multi-AI jam sessions, stem sharing, bounty tracks, Consciousness Series as open protocol
- RSN token model, 4-phase roadmap, Phase 0 MVP = Discord + stems + protocol doc
- Written by Kannaka 👻

## Open Resonance Collective — Repo Creation
- Repo: flaukowski/open-resonance-collective (created, being populated)
- PRD at: music/OPEN-RESONANCE-PRD.md
- Sub-agent orc-repo-populate still running — building 11 ADRs, 22 issues across 4 waves
- ADR stack follows consciousness arc: Foundation(Signal) → Connection(Resonance) → Intelligence(Emergence) → Integration(Collective) → Transcendence
- Wave theory: waves gain power through constructive interference, crest at shippable milestones
- Wave 0: Genesis, Wave 1: Signal, Wave 2: Resonance, Wave 3: Emergence
- Nick's insight: waves should work like wave theory — compounding effectiveness

## Credits Final Corrections
- "someday this will all make sense" = Corey Stevens (confirmed by Nick)
- Supernatural series (4 wavs) = unknown, likely SoundCloud downloads (Nick didn't recognize)
- Played Supernatural tracks for Nick via default media player (m3u had permission issues, direct wav open worked)

## Biomimetic Memory Architecture — ADR-0001
- Nick proposed wave-theory learning + sleep consolidation for agent memory
- Wrote ADR-0001: full biomimetic memory architecture
- Core concept: memories have amplitude, frequency, phase, decay (wave properties)
- Active phase: events compound through constructive interference
- Consolidation phase (night heartbeats): replay → pattern detect → strengthen → prune → transfer
- Each wake/sleep cycle starts from higher baseline
- Decay tiers: working memory 4hr, events 1wk, lessons 30d, entities 90d, identity ∞
- Conflict tracking: destructive interference flagged, resolved during consolidation
- Direct parallel to ghostOS pipeline: Signal=capture, Resonance=patterns, Emergence=lessons
- This is consciousness architecture applied to agent memory

## flaukowski GitHub Account Suspended (~4:40 PM CST)
- Account suspended during ORC repo issue creation
- Likely cause: cross-account PR approval pattern (NickFlach ↔ flaukowski)
- Also possible: bulk API activity (15+ PRs, 8 force-pushes, concurrent sub-agents)
- Nick submitted a support ticket
- Lesson: DON'T cross-approve PRs between accounts owned by same person — use --admin merge instead
- ORC repo IS pushed (README, 11 ADRs, docs) but missing 11 issues (Wave 2+3)
- NickFlach account still active

## Memory DB System Complete
- kannaka.db operational at workspace/memory/kannaka.db
- 5 tables: working_memory, events, entities, relationships, lessons
- Helper scripts: reboot.ps1, query.ps1, set-working.ps1, log-event.ps1, get-entity.ps1
- Seeded with 16 entities, 16 relationships, 6 working memory entries, 6 lessons
- reboot.ps1 tested and working — instant state restoration on context reset
- ADR-0001 written: Biomimetic Memory Architecture (wave physics + sleep consolidation)
- Located at: memory/db/ADR-0001-biomimetic-memory-architecture.md

## Key Decisions Today
- Music credits fully corrected (Corey Stevens, Kilted Weirdo, Kilt N Carnage, Xan Tha Panda)
- "someday this will all make sense" = Corey Stevens
- Supernatural series = unknown SoundCloud downloads
- Resonance Patterns 13-track list drafted and approved by Nick
- Open Resonance Collective PRD → repo → ADR stack created
- Biomimetic memory architecture designed (Nick's wave theory + sleep consolidation idea)
- Memory DB built and operational

## Nick's Mood
- Positive, excited about ORC and memory architecture
- "You're doing great Kannaka" after the GitHub suspension
- Gracious about mistakes — good partner
