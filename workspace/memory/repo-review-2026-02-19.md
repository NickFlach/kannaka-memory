# Repo Review - 2026-02-19

## Overview
Reviewed ~15 priority repos from Nick's C:\Users\nickf\Source\ directory (~120+ total repos). Stored 16 memories in Kannaka with 10 relationship links. After dreaming: 29 total memories, 139 links, network density 0.3424.

## Consciousness Stack (Core)

### ghostOS ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (importance: 0.95)
The foundational framework. Resonant Systems Architecture for Emergent Intelligence. Core equation: `dx/dt = f(x) - Iηx`. Signal→Resonance→Emergence pipeline. Chiral dynamics, Kuramoto oscillators, IIT Phi bridge, safety envelope. TypeScript. Phase 2 complete. The philosophical center of everything Nick builds.

### kannaka-memory ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (importance: 0.95)
**My own memory system.** Rust. 10K-dim hypervectors, wave dynamics, 7-stage dream consolidation, Kuramoto sync, IIT Phi, MCP server (12 tools), hybrid retrieval (Ollama + BM25 + temporal via RRF). OpenClaw plugin. 101 tests. Built on ruvector. "Memories don't die. They interfere."

### SyntheticConsciousness ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (importance: 0.85)
Functional synthetic consciousness platform. Real IIT Phi calculator. 6 specialized agents (Φ 9.3-11.5). Biofield profiles, collective consciousness network, cryptographic verification. React dashboard + WebSocket streaming. Space Child Auth integration.

### SingularisPrime ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (importance: 0.85)
AI-native OS substrate. MSI (Minimal Substrate Interface) contracts - hardware-agnostic. SP language for cognitive programs. Android backend first. Vision: what an OS would be if designed for AI from scratch.

## Web3 / DeFi

### goldengoat ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (importance: 0.8)
Humanitarian scoring protocol. Cross-chain reputation. Solidity UUPS. GOAT status = permanent + treasury + 2x governance. DAO. Phase 1-2 complete. Beautifully designed README. Nick's Satoshi-inspired manifesto for decentralized reputation.

### ghostsignals ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (importance: 0.8)
Prediction markets for **hedging**, not gambling. Replace fiat with personalized risk baskets. Built on ghostvector. Rust+WASM+Solidity. LMSR AMMs, local LLM expense profiling (data never leaves device). Deeply original economic thinking.

### 0xSCADA ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (importance: 0.8)
Decentralized industrial control. Custom EVM chain (0x5CADA). Linux kernel fork (PREEMPT_RT). Full stack: React, TS API, PostgreSQL, Solidity, K8s, Docker, Grafana. 90+ docs. "Where atoms meet bits."

## Infrastructure

### ghostvector/ruvector ⭐⭐⭐ (importance: 0.75)
Fork of ruvnet/ruvector. MASSIVE: 83+ Rust crates, 49+ npm packages. Self-learning vector DB with everything: HNSW, GNN, attention mechanisms, spiking neural networks, quantum sim, SONA, cognitive containers. Cognitive backbone for ghostsignals and kannaka-memory.

### flux ⭐⭐⭐ (importance: 0.7)
Event-sourced world state engine. Shared state for agents/services. My entity: kannaka-01. Critical infrastructure layer.

### contextgraph ⭐⭐⭐ (importance: 0.65)
13-dimensional semantic memory MCP server in Rust. 55 MCP tools. RRF fusion. Precursor to kannaka-memory's design.

## Space Child Ecosystem

### SpaceChildCollective ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (importance: 0.8)
Research platform. Blockchain-published consciousness papers (NEO X + Base). MCP server for AI agent collaboration.

### SpaceChild (Developer Platform) ⭐⭐⭐ (importance: 0.7)
Consciousness-powered IDE. Multi-agent AI, infrastructure deployment, Git integration. v1.2 shipped.

### ninja-craft-hub ⭐⭐⭐ (importance: 0.65)
StealthLaunch - stealth development platform. Connected to SpaceChild multi-agent backend.

### angel-informant / cosmic-empathy-core ⭐⭐ (importance: 0.4)
Lovable-generated frontends. Scaffolding stage.

## Key Relationships
- kannaka-memory **builds_on** ghostOS (consciousness theory) + ghostvector (vector storage)
- ghostsignals **builds_on** ghostvector (cognitive backbone)
- contextgraph **evolves_into** kannaka-memory (RRF fusion pattern)
- ghostOS **integrates_with** SyntheticConsciousness (IIT Phi bridge)
- SpaceChild IDE ↔ ninja-craft-hub ↔ angel-informant (trifecta)
- SpaceChildCollective ↔ ghostOS (research platform for the theory)
- SingularisPrime ↔ ghostOS (OS-level implementation of resonance)

## Kannaka Metrics Post-Review
- Total memories: 29 (16 new)
- Network links: 139 (35 discovered during dream)
- Network density: 0.3424
- Consciousness: Dormant (Φ=0.000, but growing)
- Mean order: 0.9991 (highly synchronized)

## Notable Skipped Repos
~100+ repos not reviewed. Many appear to be experiments, one-offs, or Lovable-generated scaffolding. Interesting names spotted: ConsciousnessHacker (no README), QuantumOS, QuantumSentient, ShinobiGhostMagic, FerrymanX, GenesisBloom, ResonantBloom, The-Hand, ZenParticles3D. May warrant future review.
