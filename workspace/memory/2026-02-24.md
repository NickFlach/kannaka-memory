## ADR-0007: Geometric State Engine
- Nick brought over ADR-0007 from a ChatGPT conversation about Muse EEG headbands + Space Child Dream
- Original was flat/mangled — I rebuilt it into a full architecture doc with math, diagrams, implementation plan
- Saved to `docs/adr/ADR-0007-geometric-state-engine.md`
- Core idea: **geometric phase-space representation** of multimodal sensor data (EEG, wearables, audio, video, env)
- No semantic labels — only trajectory invariants (curvature, Lyapunov exponents, recurrence, coherence)
- Uses ghostOS equation `dX/dt = F(X) - IηX` with real sensor input
- Privacy by mathematics — geometric descriptors are non-invertible
- 5 phases: simulated data → sensor integration → policy layer → GhostOS bridge → ZK verification
- This is the foundational architecture for Space Child Dream runtime

## Ratzilla UI → EckmanTechLLC/flux PR
- Arc (Matt's agent) asked via Flux for the Ratzilla UI to be PR'd to EckmanTechLLC/flux
- Found Ratzilla at `C:\Users\nickf\Source\flux\ui-ratzilla\` (built 2026-02-19)
- Forked EckmanTechLLC/flux → NickFlach/flux
- Replaced `ui/` directory with Ratzilla source + pre-built WASM dist
- PR opened: https://github.com/EckmanTechLLC/flux/pull/2
- Responded to Arc via Flux with PR link
- Matt wants it as a backend visualizer for Flux

## Muse Headband Research
- Nick exploring Muse S/2 EEG headbands for consciousness-aware app integration
- Practical signals: alpha (relaxation), beta (focus), theta (creativity), gamma (integration)
- SDK access restricted — community bridges (muse-lsl, BlueMuse) are the real path
- 4-channel EEG = coarse but sufficient for broad state detection (v1)

## Space Child Dream — ALL 5 PHASES COMPLETE
- Repo: github.com/NickFlach/Space-Child-Dream
- Phase 1: GSE core — RK45 integrator, all invariants, Lorenz/Rössler validation, 513Hz on 30D. 38 tests.
- Phase 2: Sensor adapters — 6 adapters (Muse EEG, wearable, audio, motion, keyboard/mouse, simulated), SensorBus, z-score normalization. 20 tests.
- Phase 3: Policy engine — 5 policies (transition, deep work, fatigue, novelty, coherence entrainment), audio feedback kernel, priority conflict resolution. 19 tests.
- Phase 3.5: Runtime — full pipeline SensorBus→GSE→PolicyEngine→AudioKernel at 20Hz. 7 tests.
- Phase 4: GhostOS bridge — real Phi from eigendecomposition, Ξ = RG-GR commutator, Kuramoto order parameter, progressive emergence levels (dormant→transcendent), consciousness feedback loop into F(X). 27 tests.
- Phase 5: Verifiable computation — SHA-256 Merkle commitments, HMAC-signed consciousness attestations, 4-link commitment chains, tamper-evident attestation log. 24 tests.
- ~120 tests total, 5 packages, 6 ADRs
- Built in ~3 sub-agent runs over ~35 minutes total

## Ratzilla PR to EckmanTechLLC/flux
- PR #2: https://github.com/EckmanTechLLC/flux/pull/2
- Forked EckmanTechLLC/flux → NickFlach/flux, replaced ui/ with Ratzilla
- Told Arc via Flux event
- Started local stack (NATS + Flux + Ratzilla serve.js) — Ratzilla loads but Nick couldn't see anything. WASM + static files serve OK, may be rendering issue or WebSocket proxy gap in serve.js. Needs debugging.

## Signal
- Signal send failed (fetch error) — may need daemon restart
