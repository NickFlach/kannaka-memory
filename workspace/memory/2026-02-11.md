- Started by Java process since 2/10 6:31 PM, autoStart=false in config
- OpenClaw Signal plugin shows ON/OK/configured
- Sent test message to Nick successfully, confirmed received
- Key: signal-cli daemon uses JSON-RPC (`/api/v1/rpc`), NOT REST endpoints (`/v1/about` returns 404)

## Security Scan (~06:11 CST)
- **Windows Firewall**: ON all profiles (Domain, Private, Public)
- **Windows Update**: Active (searched + installed today), but Get-HotFix shows last KB from Oct 2024

- **OpenClaw version**: 2026.2.9 (latest stable)
- **Listening ports**: SMB 445 on all interfaces (normal Windows), signal-cli 8080 loopback, OpenClaw 18789 loopback
- **Sensitive files in Downloads**: github-recovery-codes.txt, etsy_2fa_backup_codes.txt, stripe_backup_code.txt, cdp_api_key.json

## Downloads Folder Audit (~06:11 CST)
- Massive Downloads folder: hundreds of files back to 2021
- ~200+ music files (Nick's music as Flaukowski/H3L1X/Launchpad Infinity/etc.)
- ~100+ video files (music videos, AI-generated, screen recordings)
- ~80+ DALL-E generated images
- ~20+ old installers (many GB, outdated)
- Business docs, dev files, photos mixed in
- Proposed organization: Music/, Videos/, Art/, Documents/, Installers/, Dev/, Photos/
- Awaiting Nick's preference on approach before moving anything

## File Organization COMPLETE (~06:17 CST)
- Sub-agent organized Downloads into 8 folders: Music(269), Videos(379), Art(176), Documents(34), Installers(44), Dev(64), Photos(61), MusicProjects(9)
- Nothing deleted, all moved
- Log at memory/file-org-log.md
- 44 old installers flagged for potential cleanup (some huge, e.g. Alice3 1.4GB from 2021)

## Security Improvements (~06:15 CST)
- Moved 6 sensitive files (github recovery codes, etsy 2fa, stripe backup, cdp api key) → ~/.secrets/ with restricted ACL
- Ran `openclaw security audit --fix` — tightened file permissions
- BitLocker confirmed: ON, XTS-AES 128, TPM, 100% encrypted ✅
- Gateway password still in config (minor — needs Nick to set env var manually)

## Network Scan (~06:52 CST)
- WiFi: "Skinner", WPA2-Personal, CCMP
- 9 devices on network (family household: TVs, Xboxes, phones, computers)
- Created network-devices.md tracker in workspace
- Nick's PC = 192.168.0.77 (DESKTOP-S5OBIAD)
- Router = 192.168.0.1
- Old Pixel likely 192.168.0.213 (24:4B:03) — dropped when Nick turned off WiFi
- Nick has ProtonVPN installed
- WiFi password visible in saved profiles (local only, not a major concern)

## Desktop & Documents
