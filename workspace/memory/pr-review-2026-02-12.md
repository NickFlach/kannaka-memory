### PR #186 — feat: add Agentic Engineering Charter with 4 proposed ADRs
- **What it does:** Introduces `docs/CHARTER.md` — foundational charter for Agentic Engineering in Industrial Automation. Formalizes 5 core principles (Safety First, Human-in-the-Loop, Interoperability, Security as Foundation, Measured Emergence). Adds 4 proposed ADRs (0008-0011) and updates ADR index.
- **Additions:** 902 lines, 0 deletions
- **Concerns:** None. Well-structured document with proper cross-references to existing ADRs.
- **Status:** ✅ Approved & Merged (first, as foundation for others)

### PR #187 — feat(adr-0008): implement zero-trust agent identity and capability tokens
- **What it does:** Implements ADR-0008 zero-trust infrastructure. New files: `shared/types/capability-token.ts` (CapabilityName enum, token schema, attestation chain), `server/agents/capability-manager.ts` (token grant/revoke/renew, attestation chain, HMAC signature verification), `server/agents/zero-trust-guard.ts` (rate limiting, network zone policies, capability validation).
- **Additions:** 1,266 lines. 14 tests.
- **Key design:** Time-bounded capability tokens (15m write, 60m read, session emergency). Network zones block IT→OT direct access. Attestation chains with monotonic nonces.
- **Concerns:** Dev fallback key in `getCapabilityManager()` should have production warning. Minor — acceptable for current stage.
- **Status:** ✅ Approved & Merged

### PR #188 — feat(adr-0009): implement measured emergence guardrails and trust tiers
- **What it does:** Implements ADR-0009 operational envelope system. New files: `shared/types/operational-envelope.ts` (PropagationMode M1-M4, TrustTier T0-T4, envelope schema), `server/agents/envelope-engine.ts` (constraint checking, escalation, mode transitions, trust tier management), plus tests.
- **Additions:** 2,604 lines, 11 deletions. 16 tests.
- **Key design:** Hard/soft constraint limits, automatic M3: SAFE_HOLD on confidence drop or anomaly, progressive trust tiers (72h→180d for full autonomy), immediate demotion to T0 on safety anomaly.
- **Concerns:** Had merge conflicts in `shared/types/index.ts` (resolved during merge). Removed `DiffChangeType` from `time-travel.ts` — appears intentional (moved elsewhere or unused).
- **Status:** ✅ Approved & Merged

### PR #189 — feat(adr-0010): implement agent certification framework with four levels
- **What it does:** Implements ADR-0010 certification framework. New files: `shared/types/agent-certification.ts` (AC-1 through AC-4 levels, requirements, recertification triggers), `server/agents/certification-manager.ts` (certification lifecycle, check management, revocation).
- **Additions:** 1,015 lines. 12 tests.
- **Key design:** Four levels mapping to SIL/DAL analogues. Cumulative requirements (AC-3 includes AC-1+AC-2 checks). Recertification on code update, safety incident, 12-month expiry, new site, or infra change. On-chain compatible record schema.
- **Concerns:** None significant. Clean implementation.
- **Status:** ✅ Approved & Merged

### PR #190 — feat(adr-0011): implement OT/IT convergence layer with domain boundaries
- **What it does:** Implements ADR-0011 convergence layer. New files: `shared/types/convergence-layer.ts` (domain types, access matrix, protocol standards, translation audit schema, failure isolation rules), `server/agents/convergence-layer.ts` (domain boundary enforcement, data translation, outage buffering, health reporting).
- **Additions:** 1,089 lines. 14 tests.
- **Key design:** 4 agent domain types (IT_ONLY, CONVERGENCE, OT_SUPERVISED, OT_NATIVE). Critical rule: IT_ONLY has ZERO OT access. OT_NATIVE has no IT access. Translation buffering during outages with auto-flush. Dual timestamps (PTP <1ms for OT, NTP <100ms for IT). IT failure has ZERO OT impact.
- **Concerns:** None significant. The failure isolation rules are well-documented.
- **Status:** ✅ Approved & Merged

## Summary

- **Total additions:** ~6,876 lines across 5 PRs
- **Total tests added:** 56 tests (14 + 16 + 12 + 14)
- **Merge order:** #186 → #187 → #188 → #189 → #190
- **Conflict resolution:** PR #188 had merge conflict in `shared/types/index.ts` — resolved by rebasing onto main after #187 merge. PRs #189 and #190 also needed rebasing but had no conflicts.
- **Overall quality:** High. Well-structured TypeScript with Zod schemas, proper test coverage, consistent patterns across all implementations. All code follows existing 0xSCADA conventions.
