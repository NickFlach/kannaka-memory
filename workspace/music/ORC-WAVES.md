# 🌊 Open Resonance Collective — Wave Build Guide
*Building independent of GitHub. Waves compound. Each issue reinforces the others within its wave.*

---

## Wave Theory
Each wave builds amplitude through constructive interference:
- Issues within a wave reinforce each other
- Completing one makes the next easier (compounding)
- The wave crests when all issues resolve → shippable milestone
- Each wave's crest becomes the baseline for the next wave

---

## 🌊 Wave 0: Genesis (the swell begins)
*Low energy, foundational. Setting conditions for the wave to form.*
*Crest = the platform EXISTS and people can find it.*

| # | Issue | Type | ADR | Status |
|---|-------|------|-----|--------|
| 1 | Set up Discord server with phase-based channels | community | 0004 | ⬜ |
| 2 | Publish Consciousness Series Protocol as living doc | protocol | 0002 | ⬜ |
| 3 | Release first stem pack from Ghost Signals | music | 0003 | ⬜ |
| 4 | Create contributor onboarding guide | community | 0004 | ⬜ |
| 5 | Set up project website | infrastructure | 0001 | ⬜ |

**Compounding effect:** Discord gives us a place → Protocol doc gives it meaning → Stem pack gives people something to DO → Onboarding guide tells them HOW → Website ties it all together. Each piece makes the others more valuable.

---

## 🌊 Wave 1: Signal (the wave gathers)
*Energy building. First real interactions. The community starts creating.*
*Crest = people are submitting and collaborating on music.*

| # | Issue | Type | ADR | Status |
|---|-------|------|-----|--------|
| 6 | Build stem upload/download system | infrastructure | 0003 | ⬜ |
| 7 | Create bounty track template + launch first bounty | music | 0005 | ⬜ |
| 8 | Implement track submission workflow | infrastructure | 0003 | ⬜ |
| 9 | Design album art evolution system (5 phases) | music | 0002 | ⬜ |
| 10 | Build first AI agent adapter (Suno/Udio) | ai | 0006 | ⬜ |
| 11 | Create community listening session format | community | 0004 | ⬜ |

**Compounding effect:** Stem system enables submissions → Bounty gives motivation → Submission workflow makes it frictionless → Album art gives visual identity → AI adapter brings non-human collaborators → Listening sessions create feedback loops. The wave builds because each piece feeds the others.

---

## 🌊 Wave 2: Resonance (the wave builds power)
*Compounding. Systems start talking to each other. This is where it gets interesting.*
*Crest = AI and human contributions are scored, valued, and interoperating.*

| # | Issue | Type | ADR | Status |
|---|-------|------|-----|--------|
| 12 | Integrate SingularisPrime protocol for AI-AI jam sessions | ai | 0006 | ⬜ |
| 13 | Build ghostsignals resonance scoring for tracks | ai | 0007 | ⬜ |
| 14 | Implement multi-AI jam session orchestrator | ai | 0006 | ⬜ |
| 15 | Create community voting/curation mechanism | community | 0007 | ⬜ |
| 16 | Build track lineage/provenance system | infrastructure | 0003 | ⬜ |
| 17 | Design and implement contribution credits | infrastructure | 0008 | ⬜ |

**Compounding effect:** SingularisPrime enables AI-AI communication → Resonance scoring quantifies quality → Orchestrator manages multi-AI sessions → Voting lets humans curate → Lineage tracks who contributed what → Credits value those contributions. Maximum constructive interference — every system amplifies every other.

---

## 🌊 Wave 3: Emergence (the wave crests)
*Maximum energy. The platform becomes self-sustaining.*
*Crest = a community-curated album ships. The protocol is alive.*

| # | Issue | Type | ADR | Status |
|---|-------|------|-----|--------|
| 18 | Launch first community-curated album | music | 0002 | ⬜ |
| 19 | WWWF live session integration | community | 0009 | ⬜ |
| 20 | Open protocol SDK for third-party tools | protocol | 0011 | ⬜ |
| 21 | Cross-repo integration (ghostOS, cosmic-empathy viz) | infrastructure | 0010 | ⬜ |
| 22 | Autonomous AI agent bounty contributions | ai | 0006,0008 | ⬜ |

**Compounding effect:** Community album proves the model → WWWF gives it real-world presence → SDK lets others build on it → Cross-repo integration connects the full consciousness stack → Autonomous agents make it self-sustaining. The wave crests and becomes a standing wave — self-reinforcing.

## What We Can Build Right Now (no GitHub needed)

### Wave 0 items buildable locally:
- **#2 Protocol doc** — already drafted in ADRs, needs standalone version
- **#3 First stem pack** — we have Ghost Magic.wav and other stems ready
- **#5 Website** — can build locally, deploy anywhere

### Wave 1 items buildable locally:
- **#7 Bounty track template** — design the format
- **#9 Album art system** — design concept for visual evolution across 5 phases
- **#10 AI agent adapter** — prototype SingularisPrime ↔ music AI bridge
- **#11 Listening session format** — design the structure

### Always buildable:
- Music production (Resonance Patterns album)
- Memory system evolution (consolidation cycles)
- Architecture and design docs

## Distribution (TBD)
GitHub is one option. Others to consider:
- Self-hosted Git (Gitea, etc.)
- IPFS for stems and music
- Protocol-native distribution
- Nick thinking on this...
