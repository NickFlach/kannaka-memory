# witness-prune-cron.sh — keep the witness HRM from growing unbounded.
#
# Run hourly from cron. When the HRM crosses the SIZE threshold (or the memory
# count crosses THRESHOLD) it backs up the HRM, prunes audio perception
# memories by content prefix, and restarts the witness loop (so `kannaka hear`
# doesn't race the prune on the HRM lock).
#
# Prefixes pruned:
#   audio:heard   — current descriptive perception memories (ADR: hear stores
#                   "audio:heard <tempo> <tags> | ...")
#   audio:/tmp/   — legacy path-only memories from before the descriptive change
#   audio:/var/tmp/
#
# v2 (2026-07-04, incident postmortem): the previous version parsed the memory
# count out of `kannaka stats` human output. That failed SILENTLY twice —
# first a corrupted on-host heredoc (2026-06-17), then the stats output format
# changed ("Total memories: N") and hourly stats runs overlapped on the HRM
# lock, so the parse returned 0 → "below threshold" every hour while the HRM
# grew to 453 MB. Lessons baked in here:
#   1. flock guard — hourly runs can never overlap
#   2. PRIMARY trigger is HRM file SIZE (cannot lie, costs nothing)
#   3. count comes from status-cache.json (no HRM load, no lock contention)
#   4. below-threshold runs spawn no kannaka process at all
#   5. orphaned atomic-save temp files are cleaned (they strand when a save
#      fails on a full disk and then accelerate the fill)
